## Game Overview
This is a Cryptogram puzzle game, and you will be deciphering some text and that text is a title of an episode of Gilmore Girls. For more on [Cryptograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram). For a list of Gilmore Girl [episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gilmore_Girls_episodes).

Since the game can take a while to actually play, you might notice that the answer is printed out at the beginning of a round of play...obviously this is just for testing purposes. :satisfied:

## Project Requirements Met
- Implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Created a class, then created at least one object of that class and populate it with data
- Created a dictionary or list, populated it with several values, retrieved at least one value, and used it in the program
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application (scraped a webpage using Beautiful Soup)
- Created and called at least 3 functions, at least one of which returned a value that is used
